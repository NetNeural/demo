- **Target Completion**: 95%+ by end of August

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Test Implementation**: Must be addressed immediately
2. **Golioth Integration**: Requires focused development effort
3. **Reporting Interface**: Basic implementation needed for MVP
4. **Performance Validation**: Load testing for production readiness

## 🚨 Risk Analysis

### High Priority Risks
- **No Test Coverage**: Blocks production deployment confidence
- **Incomplete Golioth Integration**: Core IoT functionality at risk
- **Missing Reporting Interface**: MVP requirement not met

### Medium Priority Risks
- **Performance Under Load**: May need architecture adjustments
- **Documentation Gaps**: Could slow user adoption
- **Support Infrastructure**: Team scaling needed for post-launch

### Low Priority Risks
- **Minor TODO Items**: Mostly cosmetic improvements
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Enhancement rather than blocker
- **Advanced Features**: Post-MVP considerations

## 📋 Action Items by Priority

### Immediate (Week 1)
1. **Implement Basic Test Coverage** - Backend services unit tests
2. **Complete Golioth Integration** - API integration and pipeline testing
3. **Create Basic Reporting Interface** - Essential MVP functionality
4. **Performance Testing Setup** - Load testing infrastructure

### Short Term (Weeks 2-3)
1. **Comprehensive Test Suite** - Integration and end-to-end tests
2. **Advanced Reporting Features** - Export and scheduling capabilities
3. **Performance Optimization** - Based on test results
4. **Documentation Enhancement** - User guides and API docs

### Medium Term (Weeks 4-6)
1. **Security Hardening** - Penetration testing and vulnerability assessment
2. **Monitoring Implementation** - Application monitoring and alerting
3. **User Acceptance Testing** - End-to-end validation with stakeholders
4. **Production Deployment Preparation** - Final deployment checklist
